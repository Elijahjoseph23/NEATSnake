# NEATSnake
Using the built-in python neat algorithm to create an AI that knows how to play snake!

Instructions:
1) Create your own environment and download the requirements
2) Run train.py
   -If you want to continue from a checkpoint, simply change the value of gen from None to whatever your last checkpoint file number is
   -If you want to run the best AI snake, change line 62 to test_winner(config)
3) The longer it runs, the better it should get!

Here's what I was able to get in 367 generations (about 102 hours):
